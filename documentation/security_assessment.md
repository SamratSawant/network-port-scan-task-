# Security Assessment and Risk Analysis

## Risk Matrix

| Device | Service | Port | Risk Level | Justification |
|--------|---------|------|------------|---------------|
| 192.168.1.1 | SSH | 22 | Medium | Admin access, potential brute force |
| 192.168.1.1 | HTTP | 80 | Medium | Unencrypted admin interface |
| 192.168.1.1 | UPnP | 1900 | Low | Automatic port forwarding risk |
| 192.168.1.100 | MySQL | 3306 | **HIGH** | Unauthorized database access |

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Database Compromise
1. Attacker discovers open MySQL port
2. Attempts connection without credentials
3. Gains access to database contents
4. Potential data exfiltration or corruption

### Scenario 2: Router Takeover
1. Attacker targets router admin interface
2. Attempts default/weak credential attacks
3. Gains network control
4. Pivots to internal devices

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)
- [ ] Secure MySQL database with authentication
- [ ] Change router default passwords
- [ ] Update router firmware

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement network firewall rules
- [ ] Regular security scanning schedule
- [ ] Document network devices and services

### Long-term Actions (1-3 months)
- [ ] Network segmentation implementation
- [ ] Intrusion detection system
- [ ] Security awareness training
